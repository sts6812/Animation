<div data-layer="text" class="text"><span class="text_span">Craft your story with the same editing and trimming tools used by Hollywood pros. Quickly insert and add clips from bins or drag clips between multiple timelines, use 3- and 4-point editing, and create J and L cuts with ease. Trim and tighten with tools such as ripple, roll, slip and slide until itâ€™s just right.</span></div>
